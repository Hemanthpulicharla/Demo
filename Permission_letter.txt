Subject: Request for permission to conduct a farewell meet

Dear sir,

We are writing to request permission to conduct a farewell event for final year students.

We believe that this event is important for several reasons. 

First, it is a chance for students to reflect on their time at the university and to say goodbye to their classmates and teachers, and to thank them for their support during their time at the institute.This can be a very emotional time for students, and we believe that the event will provide them with closure.We also believe that this event will be a positive reflection on the institute.


Second, the event will allow students to celebrate their achievements. This is a very important time in their lives, and we want to make sure that they have a chance to celebrate and the farewell meet would allow us to show our appreciation for our graduating students. They have worked hard over the past few years, and we want to show them how much we appreciate their efforts.

Third, the event will give students a chance to network with each other. This is an important time in their careers, and we believe that the event will help them to make connections with each other.Also the farewell meet will provide an opportunity for the incoming students to meet the outgoing students and get to know them. This can be a valuable bonding experience for the incoming students.


We believe that this event is important for the students.We understand that this event would require some planning and coordination. However, we believe that it would be well worth the effort and we would be grateful for your permission to go ahead with it.

Thanking you sir,

Yours obedient,
Mechanical branch students,
