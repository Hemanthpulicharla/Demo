I'm so excited to share my recent trip to Goa! It's so much exhilarating and fun. We had an amazing time exploring everything the place had to offer. From the stunning architecture to the serene beaches, we were truly blown away. I can't wait to share all the details of my trip with you all!…. So, let's start off with the conceptions and arrangements that have been happening behind the scenes for some time.

Basically, I wouldn't have been in this trip had my friends didn't persuade me to be part of this because I had neither the intent nor the luxury to afford for it. The single most thing that had driven my intent is this thought that we have one life  to do anything that is too short to postpone for explorations and adventures/feats. Also, I was convinced by the fact that these friends won't be there with me in the future (probably not with the same kind of rapport even though they happen to be) as we virtually in the final year of our university.When we have strong enough intent, every other thing will fall into its right place, just as my family supported(without whom we can't have even a single rupee 😆😊) on the financial front even in this trying times as well.

Now, when all the things set right for all people involved and tickets have been almost 20 days before the trip, and we have been on a spree to check out various YouTube review and vlog videos and checked on the blogging sites as well to prepare a roadmap of which places to visit in correspondence to their distances and our convenience but in the end only to find out that we have forgot that paper and no one of us have taken any capture of it 🤣🤣. So, we have to do everything from scratch which we proposed to do in that long 18 hours train journey to the Vasco da Gama from Tirupathi, but ironically all of us have either exhausted and slept away or distracted to do something other 😂😅(Only one happen to make some vague planning and roadmap). We have taken only bread with jam and some snacks as food to fuel ourselves during that long train journey since we all know the quality of food inside trains 😄😅 and that turns out to be a great experience to have only eaten bread for two days.We all kinda pounce on the camera to click some photos of ourselves at various junctions on the go(faced some tough competition as well to be in the frame 😅😉).

After landing in the Vasco da Gama station, we are clueless about how to proceed and which way to move on further but only thing we know is to reach and visit Panaji and north Goa as such we just followed some cues and fellow people and then hopped onto buses to Panaji and then to North Goa(Calangute). One specific thing we observed is that ladies in Goa are much brave and progressive, and we need to learn and adopt a lot from them. For instance, they don't hesitate to sit in a single seat that has been surrounded by the seats occupied by the male passengers, which are upfront in design.


We visited the Calungute beach the same evening we landed and been completely blown by the serenity of the ocean and of course the people as well 😁. Some of us tried some reels, and others posed for photos. The next day, we have taken the rental bikes for covering up the places to visit but none of us have any license except one which caused a black swan event in our trip. And then a visit to santhoshi maata temple and then to Agauda fort wherein we met some forest friends. From there we head off to Panaji to visit some famous churches and structures, but it ended up paradoxically worse that triggered a chain of events that we have to resolve one after the other and then been to baga beach clubs and parties the same night. Rain poured in most of North Goa, due to which there is no power which ceases the water availability in the hotel room, and we kinda were running from post to pillar. From there we shopped a bit (which includes all those drinks' thing for people at home 😁😅) up to evening and then hopped onto buses to Vasco da Gama at which point we are fully exhausted.

And then there to yashwantpur junction in Bengaluru and then from there to CANT station to board on the train to Vijayawada.
 
We believe that the best qualia moments would be those that are random and unintentional ones but not the planned as such we strive to have as much randomness as possible and the events unfolded are also like that only. We also learned that these kinds of trips are a great way to learn about our personalities and our relationship to the society, and also we came to know each other very well. Furthermore, apparently we might seem like gullible enough for the locals, but we kept breaking that image on the go.


Each one of us in the group have unique abilities, personas and played different roles in our journey, experiencing which is such a wonderful thing to have in the whole trip. Let's chip a bit on this front.

1. Siva Teja (extreme left in the pic): He is like an accountant to the trip who kinda manages all the transactions and takes responsibility for all pooled money for all of us. He is like that cheeky guy in every gang who cracks the spontaneous auto punches virtually out of any situation. His poses for photos can't be matched up  by anyone.

2. Venkatesh (second most from left in pic): He is like that daring guy in every gang who don't even have any second thoughts in doing things, and he had a crime partner in the name of Vasu pairing up with whom, the duo can't be persuaded in doing or not doing  certain things. He renamed himself as butter scotch in this trip 😂.   

3. Jagadeesh (third most from left in the back): He is like the dealbreaker in our group who is sort of upfront in finding resolutions to the riddling situations we happen to stuck in. I have learned so much from him over the years from various trips we together made, and he is just as funny as responsible he is. My frequency perfectly lines up with him. The only one who sleeps more hours of time than anyone in our group, his hunger for sleep is  unending.

4. Vasu (fourth most from left in the front in pic): He is the partying guy in every gang who kind of instantly arouses to any situation to enjoy the present moment of time. The other member of the duo in our grouping. In this trip, he finally got his pics ready for bridal glances(పెళ్లి చూపులు).  The biryani lover.

5. Srikanth (5th from left in the back in the pic): He is the only one in the group who had license for a two-wheeler, which saved us many times to tide over the police checkups. With his photogenic face, he sets a benchmark for all of us.

6. Balaji (2nd from extreme right): He is the cameraman for the whole of our trip, but ironically most of the pics (by count) in the cam are his only 😑🤨. He is the pose setter as well for our grouping. 


I personally don't like people to identify with certain wordings or fit them into narrow definitions of the sort which are purely abstract and are a result of fragmented observations, for which it doesn't hold any waters. Being judgmental, that too with a limited number of experiences, is like getting fooled by randomness. But I find no other way to describe, and please let me know if you think of any way of doing it in the comment section. So take these on a lighter vein, never to assign any value or image to it.

In conclusion, we can say that this trip contains more of life lessons, adventures, and memories to cherish and less of enjoyment and relaxations, whose definition is highly subjective to each individual. We miss some of our friends in this due to various at constraints at their end and at our end as well 😌😪, but this is not the final trip of sorts. We sympathize with all those who can't make it to Goa.
Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions regarding anything, and please never hesitate to point out any shortcomings in my perspective or thinking framework!!!!

Cheers 🍻🥂!!
